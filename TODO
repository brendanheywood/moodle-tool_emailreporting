MAYBE track references ID - if we 'open' a messageid should we also cascase this to any other prior messages in the same thread? this will eliminate a lot of false negatives in threaded emails


track emails blokced inside email_to_user
track emails gone to post fix
track emails failed at postfix
track emails opened in inbox

track emails click on
